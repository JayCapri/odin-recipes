        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            apanese Chicken Wings, often referred to as "Tebasaki," are a popular dish characterized by their crispy texture, sweet and savory glaze, and a hint of spiciness. These wings are typically fried until golden and crunchy, then tossed in a sticky sauce made from a blend of soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and other flavorful ingredients. This combination results in wings that are both juicy on the inside and coated with a caramelized exterior, delivering a perfect balance of flavors and textures.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Place beaten egg in a small bowl. Place flour in a shallow bowl.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Cut wings in half. Dip each piece in egg, then press in flour to coat.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Melt butter in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Fry coated wings in hot butter until deep brown on both sides. Place in a shallow roasting pan.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Make sauce: Mix together sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, water, salt, and garlic powder in a medium bowl until combined. Pour over wings.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, basting wings frequently with sauce in the roasting pan. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers of wings near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
