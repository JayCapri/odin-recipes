        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water, and set aside.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, place chicken in a saucepan with enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Cook until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Remove chicken from the saucepan and shred.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Combine shredded chicken, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, and cream cheese in a large bowl. Dissolve hot water and bouillon in a liquid measure; pour over chicken mixture and stir until well combined.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Spread 1/3 of the spaghetti sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 1/2 of the chicken mixture and top with 3 lasagna noodles; repeat. Top with remaining sauce and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.
